With the passing of a basketball icon, I have decided to analyze every shot Kobe Bryant has taken during his 20-year career. In the dataset below, you will see data containing the location and circumstance of every field goal Kobe has ever attempted in the NBA. I will use the tidyverse package for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. 

I am a third-year undergraduate student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. At school, I study Civil Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. My studies focus on transit modeling, intelligent transportation systems, engineering economics, with project management aspirations.

I recently joined the Kaggle community and continue to learn and develop my skills and knowledge. So if you are ever curious and want to meet up for a coffee, I'm one message away!
