I love sports! I love money as well! This project aims to utilize what I learned about linear regression and create a model that predicts the salaries of NBA players based on metrics such as PPG, APG, RPG, TOPG, BLK//G, SPG. I hope you find this data analysis interesting!

I am a third-year undergraduate student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. At school, I study Civil Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. My studies focus on transit modeling, intelligent transportation systems, engineering economics, with project management aspirations.

I recently joined the Kaggle community and continue to learn and develop my skills and knowledge. So if you are ever curious and want to meet up for a coffee, I'm one message away!
